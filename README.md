## Introduction
Inspired by [OSSU's Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), this is my attempt at creating a self-taught education in Science and the Humanities. The 'Science' portion will focus on principles of their respective scientific fields. Computing related courses will be hosted on [MOOC](https://github.com/khkhiu/MOOC) repository. The 'Humanities' portion will focus on Philosophy, Politics, Economics and History, with a few other fields sprinkled throughout.
